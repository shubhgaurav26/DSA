Problem Statement :-
Given a total of n people and the number k, which means that k-1 people are skipped and the kth person is killed in a predetermined direction in a circle.
The count will begin at the k+1th individual after each operation.
The goal is to select a safe location within the circle so that, after performing these actions starting from the first position within the circle, you are the only one left alive.

Example 1:
Input:
n = 3 k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 people, hence the second person will die if the first 
person is skipped. The safe position is therefore 3.


Example 2:
Input:
n = 1 k = 1
Output: 1


Constraints:
1 <= k, n <= 20


CODE : 

public class Solution
{
  int solve(int n , int k ) {
      if (n==1)
      return 0 ;
      return(solve(n-1,k)+k)%n;
  }
   public int josephus(int n, int k)
    {
    int ans = solve(n,k)+1;
    return ans;
      
    }
}
