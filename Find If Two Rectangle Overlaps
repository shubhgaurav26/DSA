Problem Statement
A rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:
Input:

[1, 4, 2, 8]

[1, 3, 2, 4]

 

Output:

false

Example 2:
Input:

[2, 4, 10, 8]

[1, 2, 6, 6]

 

Output:

true

Constraints:
-109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109


CODE :

import java.util.*;

public class RectangleOverlap {
    public static boolean isRectangleOverlap(int[] rec1, int[] rec2) {
        return rec1[0] < rec2[2] && rec1[2] > rec2[0] && rec1[1] < rec2[3] && rec1[3] > rec2[1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] rec1a = {1, 4, 2, 8};
        int[] rec2a = {1, 3, 2, 4};
        int[] rec1b = {2, 4, 10, 8};
        int[] rec2b = {1, 2, 6, 6};

        System.out.println(isRectangleOverlap(rec1a, rec2a));
        System.out.println(isRectangleOverlap(rec1b, rec2b));
    }
}
