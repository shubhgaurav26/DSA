Problem Statement:-
Write a program to find Nth Fibonacci number. 
The integers in the following order are the Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.

Example 1:
Input: 
n = 1
Output: 
1 
Explanation: 
1 is the 1st number of fibonacci series.

Example 2:
Input: 
n = 2
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
1 is the 2nd number of fibonacci series.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 30



CODE : 

public class Solution {
    public int nthFibonacci(int n){

      if (n<=1)
      return n ;
      return nthFibonacci(n-1)+nthFibonacci(n-2);
      
    }
}
