Problem Statement
Swap every two adjacent nodes in a linked list A, then return the head of the list.

Note: your method should only consume constant space. Only the nodes themselves can be updated; the list's values cannot be altered.

Example 1:
Input: 
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

Output: 
2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 

Example 2:
Input: 
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 

Output: 
2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 

Constraints:
1 <= |A| <= 106
